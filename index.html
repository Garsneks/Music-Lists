<p>The app uses music stored on the device or in iCloud.
All songs that are selected by the user are saved in a list using song identifiers. For music stored on the device, these identifiers can change if the song is deleted and downloaded and it is a possibility that songs in iCloud can change identifiers. If there is a problem to load playlist try to delete this playlist and create a new one.</p>
<p>App uses swipe gestures on themes, playlists, and songs to add the possibility of editing, adding, and removing items from lists.</p>
