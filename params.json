{"name":"Music-Lists","tagline":"","body":"# Music Lists Support\r\n\r\nThe app uses music stored on the device or in iCloud.\r\nAll songs that are selected by the user are saved in a list using song identifiers. For music stored on the device, these identifiers can change if the song is deleted and downloaded and it is a possibility that songs in iCloud can change identifiers. If there is a problem to load playlist try to delete this playlist and create a new one.\r\n\r\nApp uses swipe gestures on themes, playlists, and songs to add the possibility of editing, adding, and removing items from lists.\r\n\r\nFor questions and suggestions please contact me directly at k.garsneks@gmail.com","note":"Don't delete this file!
